* Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was DriverPass, a company that helps people practice to pass their driving tests. The type of system that the company wished for us to design was a web-based application that could track a customer’s progress, make appointments, take practice tests, and purchase packages to help them become more likely to pass their driving test.

* What did you do particularly well?

In terms of what I feel I did particularly well, I feel that I did well on the systems analysis. The reason that I say this is that it fed into my past experience in IT and also the degree I already have in that particular field. It allowed me to focus in on elements that I had done in the past. This let me more easily tailor the type of software, hardware, and tools that are necessary for creating, maintaining, securing, and updating the system that the client wanted.

* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would want to revise the business requirements portion. While I can see where it would work and what I could do with it, I would want to expand upon it a bit more and explain more easily to the customer the reason behind some of the suggestions. My past experience in accounting and working on programs that clients come to a third party for has helped me see that there is more than just what was shown. Sometimes it requires more than what is normally thought of. The document that we had here was a bit more basic and I would want to revise it by expanding upon sections like the non-functional requirements. These are often treated as if they are unimportant and I have seen clients basically skip those and then wonder why it doesn’t match their needs because they thought it was unimportant. I would want to expand upon and explain certain elements in there that would help them better understand why it is important.

* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I look at the base design and see what is needed to interpret the user’s needs. When the client explains what they are looking for, they sometimes don’t get every need. Talking with users, showing a base design, and explaining what the system is helps to expand upon the needs necessary. This allows us to extrapolate the best possible scenario for the user. This is important because the user is the main client, in a sense. They are the ones that use the system and will complain, report issues, and anything else that they find. They are the ones that need to be happy. If they’re happy, they’ll use it, recommend it, and bring the company more business. That makes it important to consider their needs.

* How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach software in a manner of: what does this need to do, what is the goal of this piece of software, who will use this software, and why would anyone want to use it. I find these questions the best, as I do look to be a tech writer in the future. Once I can answer those questions, I can start to design the software in a manner that is befitting the desired end result. In the future, I will maintain these techniques and questions, but I would add in elements of, if this is broken down, how will it work. Who can do these pieces? Those are questions I would more easily look into and begin to use as a strategy because I need to know these in order to better create timelines and for the client to have visual knowledge of what they are needing.
